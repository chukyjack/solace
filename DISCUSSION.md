## Changes made

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Added database indexes on searchable fields (first_name, last_name, city, degree, specialties) for 10-100x faster queries
- Implemented server-side pagination and filtering to handle hundreds of thousands of records efficiently
- Moved filtering from client to server, reducing network transfer from MB to KB
- Added debounced search (300ms) to minimize API calls
- Created pagination UI with page numbers and controls

**User Experience:**
- Formatted phone numbers for readability: `(555) 123-4567`
- Made table scrollable with pagination always visible
- Improved component structure with modular, reusable components
- Added proper error handling and loading states

- Add advanced filters (degree type, years of experience range, city dropdown)

**Security & Validation:**
- Add explicit input sanitization for search terms
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

**Testing:**
- Add unit tests for critical components and utilities
- Add integration tests for API endpoints

**Refactoring**
- Restructure components and files
